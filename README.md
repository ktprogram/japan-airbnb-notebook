# japan-airbnb-notebook
This is the SQL, that was used for my Japan AirBNBs notebook that I made on Kaggle.

I am using the Google Cloud BigQuery for my SQL use, so any of the code that is presented will have the data from my BigQuery account. If you would like to look at the rest of the project, I will have the link down here where you can fully see what is going on.
